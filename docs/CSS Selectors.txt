CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements to style the elements

CSS selectors are divided into five categories
1. Simple Selectors
2. Combinator Selectors
3. Pseudo-class Selectors
4. Pseudo-elements Selectors
5. Attribute Selectors

1. Simple Selectors-select the elements based on name, id, class.
	
	1: Element selector- The elements selectors selects html elements based on the element name.
 
ex: p {
	text-align: centre;
	color: red;
  }
 
	2: id Selector- select an element with a specific id, use (#) character, followed by id name.

ex: #para1 {
	text-align: center;
	color: red;
}

	3: Class Selector- To select an elements with a specific class, Write (.) character, followed by the class name. html elements can also refer to more than one class.
 
ex: .center {
	text-align: Center:
	color: red;
}

In html elements we specify both element name and class name, but it will take elements name.

	4: Universal Selector- The universal selector to specify a (*) character to selects all html elements on the page.

ex: * {
	text-align: center;
	color: blue;
}

	5: Grouping selector- The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definations.
 ex; ha, h2, and p elements have the same style definations, it will be beeter to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
	h1, h2, p{
	text-align: center;
	color: red;
	}




2. Combinator Selectors- Select the elements based on specific relationship between them.

3. Pseudo-class Selectors- select the elements based on a certain state.

4. pseudo-elements selectors- select and style a part of an elements.

5. Attribute selectors- select the elemnts based on an attribute or attribute value.
